My fiance and I live in a tiny apartment with low-quality air, because the building is old and not well taken care of. Our fridge is a small and cheap one that came with the apartment and our food molds quickly. We have started freezing as much as we can to try and preserve it. We both work from home and have weird schedules, so it's hard to think about things other than work. We tend to eat out a lot and skip meals often. We're tight on money and time, so when we eat out, we eat fast food. It's difficult just to meal plan. I loved looking at all the healthy and beautiful food you eat. I am a picky eater and don't love many vegetables, but I want to be healthier. I like cabbages, raw carrots, beets, spinach, radishes, green beans, tomatoes, yellow and green onions, and cucumber. Where do you get your recipes? When you make soup (like your butternut squash soup) and rice (white and fried), do you make a big batch of it and store the rest for later or do you make new batches everytime you include it in your meals? I would greatly appreciate it if you could make a couple videos making your typical meals and some easy healthy meals. By easy I mean, not too many perishables and quick to make (1 or 2 hours) and whether or not they can be stored in a fridge for leftovers or combined in other recipes. Thank you so much, Emmy.

Its made with the same steak cuts so it has that tender, juicy texture in a sweet, savory sauce. The mushrooms in the dish also soak up all the sauce and its so good.\n\nIf you like a sweet, sour flavor then the Beijing beef is really good when its fresh. The Sweetfire chicken breast is actually made with the Thai aweet chili sauce that you mentioned and is also really good.\n\nAlso, the Broccoli Beef is delicious when made right. The broccoli soaks up all the sauce and when you bite into it, it gushes out in a savory torrent of deliciousness.\n\nFinally, ask for an order of the crispy shrimp made fresh.
