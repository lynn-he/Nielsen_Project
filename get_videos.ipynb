       "   \"I loved this, Emmy. My fiance and I live in a tiny apartment with low-quality air, because the building is old and not well taken care of. Our fridge is a small and cheap one that came with the apartment and our food molds quickly. We have started freezing as much as we can to try and preserve it. We both work from home and have weird schedules, so it's hard to think about things other than work. We tend to eat out a lot and skip meals often. We're tight on money and time, so when we eat out, we eat fast food. It's difficult just to meal plan. I loved looking at all the healthy and beautiful food you eat. I am a picky eater and don't love many vegetables, but I want to be healthier. I like cabbages, raw carrots, beets, spinach, radishes, green beans, tomatoes, yellow and green onions, and cucumber. Where do you get your recipes? When you make soup (like your butternut squash soup) and rice (white and fried), do you make a big batch of it and store the rest for later or do you make new batches everytime you include it in your meals? I would greatly appreciate it if you could make a couple videos making your typical meals and some easy healthy meals. By easy I mean, not too many perishables and quick to make (1 or 2 hours) and whether or not they can be stored in a fridge for leftovers or combined in other recipes. Thank you so much, Emmy. I love all of your videos and wish you were my mom or something lol. Much love!\",\n",

Particularly with all that empty space around them.\\nI would have used slightly smaller tweeters and used up more of the horizontal space, but that\\'s me. \\nI think channel separation is worth having, despite the more traditional aesthetic of the tweeters rising and separating toward the corners.  Your design is very pretty, very symmetrical, but it may sound a bit \"mono\" if you\\'re not right up in front of the system.  It\\'s not much, but with these small boxes every inch counts.  \\nNo worries, that\\'s just an opinion about a minor detail... It really does look great!  ;-)',\n",

I'd say you did a really good job for your first time soldering. Here are my two biggest tips: 1 - put a dab of solder on the tip of the gun before touching it to the wires. This helps transmit heat from the iron to the wire. You want the wires hot enough to melt the solder, otherwise you'll get a cold joint that could break or have lots of resistance. 2 - Use spring clamps to hold your parts. Just put them on their side and clamp the part in place.\",\n",

Actually, in those 47 years I only had 2 full box sets and still have them both to this day. I retired 4 years ago so my oldest set of boxes is half a century old and still going strong. My second set is 30 years old and is as good as the day I purchased it. While my fellow techs were paying the Tool Truck guy a hundred dollars a week for years I had mine paid off in a few months at that same hundred dollars a week rate. And I ended up being able to actually purchase more needed tools with the savings or take the wife out with those savings. I have seen the boxes in the video at the store and they are heads and shoulders above my boxes so they should easily last well over half a century...

I found it nauseating and when I finally tucked into authentic noodle soup in Chinatown I wept. Wept for the Panda Express I had to endure before I could get my hands on that bowl of noodles. I'm sorry but this video just brings back my worst memories of America. \\n\\nAnd as someone who frequents Myanmar, the capital now is Naypyidaw not Yangon. Even though the action is still in Yangon.

Definitely better than most of the independent Chinese food places I grew up with on the east coast and way better than 99% of Chinese food in Denver.

Its made with the same steak cuts so it has that tender, juicy texture in a sweet, savory sauce.

The Sweetfire chicken breast is actually made with the Thai aweet chili sauce that you mentioned and is also really good.\\n\\nAlso, the Broccoli Beef is delicious when made right. The broccoli soaks up all the sauce and when you bite into it, it gushes out in a savory torrent of deliciousness.\\n\\nFinally, ask for an order of the crispy shrimp made fresh.

Idk dinner yet. Taco Bell? Haha) but just being home all day & going out to eat rather than cooking - except we are doing Home Chef now, thanks to your last video when you worked with them!, spending time with my animals, I barely go out, etc... & I still find that interesting. Bc it\\'s REAL! Events & such aren\\'t something most ppl can relate to. I can see wanting to know what goes on there but they\\'re so hectic with so many ppl, I\\'d rather watch you eat pizza & read a book, tbh. So don\\'t ever feel your life is too boring for vlogs. Casey Holmes has an entire blog channel & the only full difference with her is she shops a lot and takes \"us\" with - which you should totally do next time you go to Target, or wherever! Just call ahead to tell them you\\'re a local youtuber & see if it\\'s okay. So, anyway, there\\'s an audience, for sure. Okay, that was a long comment.
